# Contact App

Its Contact application app, where we can store our contacts with few more information

In this project we learned :
1. create architecture for node app and database as Redis cache
2. Frontend is in html

# Stack used:
1. Node.js
2. Redis
3. React.js
4. Redux.js

Redis : we configure for only local host, if we want we can directly connect with remote host of redis server and make use.

if we are using google cloud platform and want to use redis we can use in following ways:
1. create a VM under compute engine.
2. Install redis on VM and using internal Ip of VM we can connect to redis server.

if we want to manage remote redis from our local we can link remote server with our local machine using external Ip of specific VM machine.
It will make the things easy and we can configure all things by our localhost.

**Learning and building is in under process**
